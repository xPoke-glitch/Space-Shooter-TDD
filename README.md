# Space Shooter TDD
[![Made with Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Unity-57b9d3.svg?style=flat&logo=unity)](https://www.unity.com)

This is a **test project** for learning and getting use to Test Driven Development and Unit Testing in Unity using the **Unity Test Framework**.
The game project is a basic Space Shooter Game.

## The Game

It's a test project so there is not an actual objective.

The player can move left or right and shoot to the enemies

## Requirements

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.20f1 (or greater)

## How to play

The commands are the follow:
* A/D: Move the player
* K: Shoot

## Test notes

I learnt how to use the Unity Test Framework, how to create separated assemblies for the tests and scripts.

I also learnt new techniques like class mocking for testing classes (especially Monobehaviour ones) and the Dependency Injection Pattern for testing classes with Singletons dependencies.

I also understood and learnt the principles behind the TDD (Test Driven Development) and dealt with the problems of creating and maintaining test classes.
